## Running Drone in AWS

The manual steps to run a server and runner on the same instance in AWS.
The cloud init file below will install docker for you and give you a docker compose file and get the latest drone images.

### Pre-requisites

- Set up a key pair SSH or putty `https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-2#KeyPairs`
- set up a security group to allow 8080 and 22

### AWS setup

- On screen `1` Ubuntu 20.04
- On screen `2` t2.medium 4gb mem
- on screen `3` select your network
- In advanced details - inside 'user data' paste in the following

```BASH
users:
- default
- name: root
  sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
  groups: sudo
packages:
- docker-compose
- vim
```

- On screen `6` select the existing security group you created.
- Review your settings, finally select your key pair you have created.

### Installing drone

- Copy this docker compose file `https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/master/docker/compose/drone-github/docker-compose.yml`

Changing the following 3 settings

```BASH
DRONE_SERVER_PROXY_HOST=${DRONE_SERVER_PROXY_HOST}         # your aws instance hostname
DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=${DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}           # taken from your Github oauth application
DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=${DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}   # taken from your Github oauth application
```

- install docker
- run the following command `docker-compose up`

## This repository

This contains lots of different kinds of builds as listed below. Just follow their instructions to try them out.

## Drone Basics

### Conditionals

Here is a concrete example of conditional usage in drone. For more complex usage look here. `https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/conditions/`
To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./basics/conditional.yml`

### Parallelism

Here is a concrete example of parallel builds in drone. For more complex usage look here. `https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/docker/syntax/parallelism/`
To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./basics/parallel.yml`

### Triggers and multiple pipelines

Here is a concrete example of triggers and multiple pipelines in drone. For more complex usage docker usage look here. `https://docs.drone.io/quickstart/docker/`
To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./basics/triggers_and_pipelines.yml`

## Language specific build examples

### Golang build

Code lives here in the `golang` folder, it contains an example go project and a basic `.drone.yaml` file that:

- go vet
- go test
- builds a binary

To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./golang/.drone.yml`

For more advanced information on golang builds go here `https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/kubernetes/examples/language/golang/`

### Java build

Code lives here in the `java` folder, it contains an example project and a basic `.drone.yaml` file that:

- builds a class
- runs the class

To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./java/.drone.yml`

For more advanced information on Java builds go here `https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/kubernetes/examples/language/java/`

### Mysql database

Code lives here in the `mysql` folder, it runs a mysql service in a basic `.drone.yaml` file that:

- mysql service that runs the database
- mysql health check that waits on the mysql service to come up
- DDL sql step to create and insert data into a table
- DML sql step to get data from the table

To try this build. In the settings of this repo in you drone ui. Set the path for the drone file to `./mysql/.drone.yml`

For more advanced information on services go here `https://docs.drone.io/pipeline/kubernetes/syntax/services/`

## TODO's

- Add workspace setting for golang .drone.yml, to remove cd hack.
